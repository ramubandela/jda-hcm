1. find the third highest salary
2. java 8 features and difference to java 17
3. can we use local variable in lambda expressions?

        String s="";
        List.of(1,2,3,4).stream().map(x->s=s+x).collect(Collectors.toList());

        gives compile time exception saying
        Variable used in lambda expression should be final or effectively final


4. which error code will return when input validation fails(400)
5. which idempotent in http method (GET, DELETE, PUT)
6. when to use parallelStream in java8

        Yes, parallelStream() can work efficiently for 10 lakh records if:
        You’re doing CPU-bound, independent operations.
        You avoid I/O in the stream.
        Your hardware supports parallelism.
7. find how many times each character repeated in String using java?

        String s="ramuhelllo123@rtyr";
        IntStream chars = s.chars();
        Map<Character, Long> collect = chars.mapToObj(c -> (char) c).collect(Collectors.groupingBy(x -> x, Collectors.counting()));
        collect.forEach((x,y)->System.out.println(x+"  "+y));

8. why Local variable restriction in lambda ?

    Why This Restriction?
   1. ✅ Closures in Java Capture Values, Not Variables
   Java lambdas capture the value of the variable at the time the lambda is created, not a reference to the actual variable.

   So if the variable changes later, the lambda won’t see it — leading to confusing behavior.

   Restricting to final/effectively final avoids this problem.

9. what are three rules of over loading
1. method signature should be different
2. child argument get more priority
3. Specific version will get more priority

............................................
10. Overriding rules.

1. method signature must be same
2. return type same or co variant (in child class same object or child references)
3. if any method throws any compile time exception in child class then in parent class same or parent class exception should be thrown.
4. in child class scope can be increased.

11. static control flow vs instance flow
1. In static flow top to bottom identify static members from parent to child.
2. execution of static variables assignments & static blocks from parent to child
3. Execution of child class main method

12. Instance flow
1. Identification of instance members top to bottom
2. Execution of instance variable assignments instance blocks from top to bottom
3. Execution of constructor.

13. Singleton class creation and when it gets violated.

14. Immutable class when its get violated.
