1. find the third highest salary
2. java 8 features and difference to java 17
3. can we use local variable in lambda expressions?

        String s="";
        List.of(1,2,3,4).stream().map(x->s=s+x).collect(Collectors.toList());

        gives compile time exception saying
        Variable used in lambda expression should be final or effectively final


4. which error code will return when input validation fails(400)
5. which idempotent in http method (GET, DELETE, PUT)
6. when to use parallelStream in java8

        Yes, parallelStream() can work efficiently for 10 lakh records if:
        You’re doing CPU-bound, independent operations.
        You avoid I/O in the stream.
        Your hardware supports parallelism.
7. find how many times each character repeated in String using java?

        String s="ramuhelllo123@rtyr";
        IntStream chars = s.chars();
        Map<Character, Long> collect = chars.mapToObj(c -> (char) c).collect(Collectors.groupingBy(x -> x, Collectors.counting()));
        collect.forEach((x,y)->System.out.println(x+"  "+y));

8. why Local variable restriction in lambda ?

    Why This Restriction?
   1. ✅ Closures in Java Capture Values, Not Variables
   Java lambdas capture the value of the variable at the time the lambda is created, not a reference to the actual variable.

   So if the variable changes later, the lambda won’t see it — leading to confusing behavior.

   Restricting to final/effectively final avoids this problem.

9. what are three rules of over loading
1. method signature should be different
2. child argument get more priority
3. Specific version will get more priority

............................................
10. Overriding rules.

1. method signature must be same
2. return type same or co variant (in child class same object or child references)
3. if any method throws any compile time exception in child class then in parent class same or parent class exception should be thrown.
4. in child class scope can be increased.

11. static control flow vs instance flow
1. In static flow top to bottom identify static members from parent to child.
2. execution of static variables assignments & static blocks from parent to child
3. Execution of child class main method

12. Instance flow
1. Identification of instance members top to bottom
2. Execution of instance variable assignments instance blocks from top to bottom
3. Execution of constructor.

13. Singleton class creation and when it gets violated.

Thresholds for Treeification

By default:

Treeify Threshold = 8
→ If a bucket has more than 8 nodes, it gets converted into a Red-Black Tree.

Untreeify Threshold = 6
→ If tree size shrinks back to <= 6 (e.g., deletions), it converts back to linked list.

Minimum capacity = 64
→ Treeification happens only if the whole HashMap has at least 64 buckets (capacity ≥ 64).
If capacity is smaller, instead of treeifying, the HashMap will resize (rehash) to reduce collisions.

1. Difference between filter and interceptor
2. There is an array A consisting of N integers. What is the maximum sum of two integers from A that have common  first and last digits?  If there are no two integers that have common  first and last digits, the function should return −1.

   Examples:

   1. Given A = [130, 191, 10, 200], the function should return 140. The only integers in A that share first and last digits are 130 and 10.

   2. Given A = [405, 45, 300, 300], the function should return 600. There are two pairs of integers that share first and last digits: (405, 45) and (300, 300). The sum of the two 300s is bigger than the sum of 405 and 45.

   3. Given A = [30, 909, 3190, 99, 3990, 9009], the function should return 9918.
