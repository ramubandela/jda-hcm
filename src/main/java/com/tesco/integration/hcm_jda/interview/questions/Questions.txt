1. find the third highest salary
2. java 8 features and difference to java 17
3. can we use local variable in lambda expressions?

        String s="";
        List.of(1,2,3,4).stream().map(x->s=s+x).collect(Collectors.toList());

        gives compile time exception saying
        Variable used in lambda expression should be final or effectively final


4. which error code will return when input validation fails(400)
5. which idempotent in http method (GET, DELETE, PUT)
6. when to use parallelStream in java8

        Yes, parallelStream() can work efficiently for 10 lakh records if:
        You’re doing CPU-bound, independent operations.
        You avoid I/O in the stream.
        Your hardware supports parallelism.
7. find how many times each character repeated in String using java?

        String s="ramuhelllo123@rtyr";
        IntStream chars = s.chars();
        Map<Character, Long> collect = chars.mapToObj(c -> (char) c).collect(Collectors.groupingBy(x -> x, Collectors.counting()));
        collect.forEach((x,y)->System.out.println(x+"  "+y));

8. why Local variable restriction in lambda ?

    Why This Restriction?
   1. ✅ Closures in Java Capture Values, Not Variables
   Java lambdas capture the value of the variable at the time the lambda is created, not a reference to the actual variable.

   So if the variable changes later, the lambda won’t see it — leading to confusing behavior.

   Restricting to final/effectively final avoids this problem.
...................................................
9. what are three rules of over loading
1. method signature should be different
2. child argument get more priority
3. Specific version will get more priority

............................................
10. Overriding rules.

1. method signature must be same
2. return type same or co variant (in child class same object or child references)
3. if any method throws any compile time exception in child class then in parent class same or parent class exception should be thrown.
4. in child class scope can be increased.

11. static control flow vs instance flow
1. In static flow top to bottom identify static members from parent to child.
2. execution of static variables assignments & static blocks from parent to child
3. Execution of child class main method

12. Instance flow
1. Identification of instance members top to bottom
2. Execution of instance variable assignments instance blocks from top to bottom
3. Execution of constructor.

6. what is hash collision
7. difference between synchronizedmap and concurrent map
8. error codes
9. how hashmap stores in java8 after 8 elements added it will be storing into RED/BLACK tree if it has 64 buckets

Thresholds for Treeification

By default:

Treeify Threshold = 8
→ If a bucket has more than 8 nodes, it gets converted into a Red-Black Tree.

Untreeify Threshold = 6
→ If tree size shrinks back to <= 6 (e.g., deletions), it converts back to linked list.

Minimum capacity = 64
→ Treeification happens only if the whole HashMap has at least 64 buckets (capacity ≥ 64).
If capacity is smaller, instead of treeifying, the HashMap will resize (rehash) to reduce collisions.

1. Difference between filter and interceptor in spring
2. There is an array A consisting of N integers. What is the maximum sum of two integers from A that have common  first and last digits?  If there are no two integers that have common  first and last digits, the function should return −1.

   Examples:

   1. Given A = [130, 191, 10, 200], the function should return 140. The only integers in A that share first and last digits are 130 and 10.

   2. Given A = [405, 45, 300, 300], the function should return 600. There are two pairs of integers that share first and last digits: (405, 45) and (300, 300). The sum of the two 300s is bigger than the sum of 405 and 45.

   3. Given A = [30, 909, 3190, 99, 3990, 9009], the function should return 9918.

9. In kafka producer producing lot of messages and consumer not able to consume at the same speed, how to handle this case?
1. Increase Consumer Throughput
Increase the number of consumer instances in the consumer group.

Ensure the topic has enough partitions (one consumer can consume one partition at a time).

2. Block or delay the producer when Kafka is overloaded:

   acks=all
   linger.ms=10
   batch.size=32768
   buffer.memory=67108864
   max.block.ms=60000
3. Add More Kafka Partitions

   Kafka consumers scale horizontally by partition.

   If your topic only has 1 partition, only 1 consumer can consume.
10. Can two consumers can get message from same partition?

No, two consumers in the same consumer group cannot consume messages from the same Kafka partition simultaneously.

It is like a finding the longest substring and add if condition only for length
Given a string s and an integer k, find the length of the longest substring that contains
at most k distinct characters Input: String s = "eceba"; int k = 2; Explanation:
The substrings with at most 2 distinct characters are: "ec" (distinct characters: e, c)
"ece" (distinct characters: e, c) "ec" (distinct characters: e, c) "eba" (distinct characters: e, b, a) → Invalid (has 3 distinct characters)
The longest valid substring is "ece", which has a length of 3.



      TreeMap<Integer, Integer> treeMap1 = new TreeMap<>();
        treeMap1.put(1, 10);
        treeMap1.put(2, 20);

        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> treeMap2 = new TreeMap<>();
        treeMap2.put(2, 15);
        treeMap2.put(3, 25);
        treeMap2.put(4, 40);


Merge two Treemaps with custom logic
1) if a key is present in both the maps then sum the value
2) if a key is present in only one map then retain the value as it is
TreeMap1: {1=10, 2=20, 3=30}
TreeMap2: {2=15, 3=25, 4=40} Output: {1=10, 2=35, 3=55, 4=40}

2. 2xx → Success

The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

Examples:

200 OK → Standard success response.

201 Created → New resource successfully created (POST).

202 Accepted → Request accepted but processing is not complete (async).

204 No Content → Success but no body in response (e.g., DELETE).

4xx → Client Errors

The problem is on the client side (invalid request).

Examples:

400 Bad Request → Invalid syntax (e.g., malformed JSON).

401 Unauthorized → Authentication required (no/invalid token).

403 Forbidden → Authenticated but not allowed.

404 Not Found → Resource doesn’t exist.

405 Method Not Allowed → HTTP method not supported (e.g., PUT on a read-only API).

409 Conflict → Request conflicts with current state (e.g., duplicate record).

429 Too Many Requests → Rate limiting (client sent too many requests).


. 5xx → Server Errors

The problem is on the server side.

Examples:

500 Internal Server Error → Generic server failure.

502 Bad Gateway → Server acting as gateway got invalid response from upstream.

503 Service Unavailable → Server temporarily overloaded or down.

504 Gateway Timeout → Upstream server didn’t respond in time.
